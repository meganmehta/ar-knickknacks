# CS 428 Project 1 - Around the World 

This code repository contains a folder with all of the code necessary to run this project. Before cloning this repository, make sure you have the following downloaded:
- [Unity 2021.3.6f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2021.3.6)
- [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
- [Vuforia version 10.9.3](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk)

After these softwares are downloaded, clone this repo to whatever location you want locally. Here are some simple steps below: 

```
cd 
git clone https://github.com/meganmehta/mehta.megan.428project1.git
```
After cloning, open this project file within Unity Hub (this will automatically open in Unity). 

Also, you will need to construct your own physical cubes! Download the CubesforVuphoria.zip file and print out the sheets, construct the cube using scissors and tape/glue.

You will also need to create a [Vuforia Developer account](https://developer.vuforia.com/). Create a free account and get an App License key. To do this, 
go to `Develop` -> `License Manager` and click `Get Development Key`. This will create a new license key. Then copy this key, and go into Unity. In Unity, 
click `Window` -> `Vuforia Configuration` and paste the key. 

Once Vuforia has been configured and you have your physical cubes, you should be ready to run everything. Click the `Play` button in the center within Unity to run 
the application. Hold up the physical cubes to the webcam, and you should see the digital cubes pop up. It should look something like this...
